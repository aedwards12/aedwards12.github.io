# Reviewing Solutions 

### How to find other solutions
Take a look at some other students' solutions to the challenges. To do this, go to the fork icon at the top of your repo. There
should be a number next to it. Click on the number. It will take you to a graph, but above the graph, there will be a "Members" tab. 
Click on it. You should then see all the forks by other students.

### How to create a new issue
1. Click on "Issues"
2. Click on "New Issue"
3. Write your feedback (with a title) using Markdown. You can preview your markdown by clicking on the "Preview" tab.
4. When you finish, click "Submit new issue"

### Feedback
Practice writing kind, actionable, specific feedback to other students. 

Here are some sample questions to use:
- If you were going to implement the pseudocode, would it be easy to follow?
- Was the pseudocode detailed enough that you would be able to implement it easily? 
- Was the pseudocode verbose? Was it clear? 
- Proper Variable Naming - make the variable name descriptive and concise  
  * Avoid naming variables after the data structure (array, string, arr, hash, hsh, etc) 
  * Avoid numbered variables (var1, var2, var3)  
  * Avoid single character names (i, x, n)
- Proper Method Naming  
  *The name should reflect the method's single responsibility 
- Keep it DRY  
  * Condense repetitive code  
  * Create new methods to encapsulate common functions   
- Did you like the logic?
- Was every variable necessary) 
- What did the student do well?
- What could they have done better?
- How was their reflection? 
- Did you learn anything from this solution?
- Did they struggle with the same concepts according to their reflection?
- Were you able to tell how they worked through the challenge based on their reflection?
