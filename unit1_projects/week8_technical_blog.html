				<h3>What is Rails?   16 June 2014</h3>

				<h4>What is Rails</h4>
				<p>Rails is a full stack frame work built on top of the Ruby programming language. David Heinemeier is its creator. Rails is a package library called a RubyGem. Rails is specifically used to build websites.  Combined with the Ruby programming language Rails allows the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Rails is considered a server-side or back end web application development platform. Rails is designed to make building web applications simpler by utilizing convention over configurations. </p>
				<p>Ruby on rails uses the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming. A controller is a component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models directly for information and pass these on to the view. . A view in the default configuration of Rails is an erb file, which is compiled to html at run-time. </p>

				<p>Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as: create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes configuration file. </p>

				<p>Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier "out of the box", such as scaffolding that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic website.[26] Also included are WEBrick, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and Rake, a build system, distributed as a gem. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment. </p>

				<p>Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the JavaScript libraries Prototype and Script.aculo.us for Ajax.[29] Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweightSOAP for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful web services. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called Unobtrusive JavaScript to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. </p>

				<p>Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ActiveRecord (an object-relational mapping system for database access), ActiveResource (provides web services), ActionPack, ActiveSupport and ActionMailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make plugins to extend existing packages. </p>
