				<h3>Chefs in the Kitchen  8 May 2014</h3>

				<p>Shareef&#39s discussion on the culture and history of DBC was very enlightening and confirmed some of my preconceived thoughts I was having about DBC.  I felt it was very needed to here the thought process of the DBC ideologies of designing the program so that us cohorts will be successful and get the most out of our experience. I think what hit home the most was his initial discussion about what to expect and how one should become part of this crazy experience and embrace it versus expecting what I ordered on the menu.  I see myself fully diving head first into this experience. Right now, phase 0 could be a little overwhelming but at least I know what to expect when I get to the DBC building for phase 1.  Phase 0 is preparing us for the welcomed madness to come. I do feel nervous because I have a lot of expectations for myself going forward.   </p>
