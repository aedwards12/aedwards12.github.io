				<h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat 8 June 2014</h3>

				<p>Looking back at my “Affirming your Values” blog i identified core values that were important to me.  This weeks blog is about the importance of Affirmation. Dr. Carmen Harra says that we must translate “thoughts into words and eventually into actions in order to manifest our intentions.” Affirmations help change the way we think which lead to a us truly believing in our value and that nothing is impossible.  Affirmations are proven methods of self-improvement because of their ability to rewire our brains.  Knowing that I need to start reading my value blog more often and have it more on my mind then not. I should start to further believe in my value and make my actions reflect my values. If i ever recognize stereotype threat and perhaps i am involved in it. I will surely bring it up to the attention of my supervisors or further up the chain if nothing is done about it. When I am down at DBC I will take a break away from my PC and take a minute to rethink the what is going on and why am i feeling the way i am. Maybe all i need is to take a dance class to clear my mind. Often when I take myself out of the situation that is giving me trouble. I tend to rework what the issues and at some point the solution just comes to me.
