				<p>500px.com is a photography sharing website. The challenge is to focus mainly on the images and not clutter the website with too much text. The home pages is pretty simple in layout. It has minimal text. </p>

				<p>Joel Grimes is a fantastic photographer. I really enjoy his work. However, his website could use some work in my opinion. The sites purpose is to focus on his images. His layout is very simple and not up to date stylistically.  </p>
