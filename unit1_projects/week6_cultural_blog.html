				<h3>Stereotype Threat 1 June 2014</h3>

				<p>Steele & Aronson in 1995 defined the term Stereotype Threat as refering to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one&#39s group. Dr Claude Steele says that one of the major barriers holding back the achievement of Blacks, women and other underrepresented groups is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype of the fear of doing somthing that would inadvertently confim that stereotype. He additionally calls it self-handicapping. </p>
				<p>As an African-American growing up in a predominantly white town. I was one of 6 African-American kids to graduate in my senior class. I feel the stereotype threat if very real in our society today. I am not sure how it effected me acedemically but i do feel that the same pressures to outperform my peers did not exsist. I was an average student during school unlike my white friends I never felt the push to out due them during standardized testing. I think I always thought that because they were white they would do well and I could not do that well because i did not possess the same vices as they did being white or asian. In the world of computer science, the view that I have alway seen or felt would be that the white, asian or indian people where the best coders. Therefore I am not expected to do as well as they did. </p>
				<p>In contrast to education when it came to doing sports I always felt that being an African-American boy automatically meant I would be an outstanding athlete in sports. I remember playing basketball other kids would automatically come to the conclusion that i would beat them because I was black. However I never felt that way when I played baseball, that was a white sport like tennis. Which ment that sport was referred to the white kids being superior to the other races and they would automatically be giving extra-credit before they deserved it. </p>
				<p>Now that I have read and listen to a few explanations of stereotype threat. I will be more aware of the context in which it is happening in. If for example I am in the work place and I feel a certain kind of way I will possible speak to human resources and discuss how I am feeling towards what ever it is that makes me feel like I am being stereotyped.   </p>
