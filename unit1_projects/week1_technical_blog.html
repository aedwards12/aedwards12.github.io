				<h3>My Favorite Sites   28 April 2014</h3>
				<img src="http://aevisionz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ux_500px.png" alt="google" class="imageblog">

				<p>500px.com is probably my favorite site. One of my hobbies is photography. This site, in my opinion displays the images in a very elegant manner. The designers have taken great care in providing a user friendly site to host my images as well as many others. Youtube is another one of my favorite site because I love watching tutorials and staying connected with the dance community across the world. The experience of the site is very easy to get navigate. Although when you start adjusting your user profile the site becomes harder to navigate due to more content being displayed. Joel Grimes site is very boring to me. Its not very elegant. The site user friendly in its most basic form. This site does not want to make me stay on the page and explore more other than view his portfolio.</p>
