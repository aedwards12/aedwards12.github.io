				<h3>Your thinking and learning style  Feedback 21 June 2014</h3>

				<h4> My Thinking Style</h4>

				<p>Thus far my experience with DBC has been an eye opener.  My biggest struggle so far is trying to understand what the writers of the curriculum expect for each challenge.  I’m not a huge fan of using code given to me. I am not opposed it, but I prefer to write the whole solution myself from scratch. I know as a future developer, I will be required to work with other code written by various developers. I will need to be able to decipher what exactly is the intent of the code. I believe I feel this way because according the thinking test I took on http://www.cgribben.com/ the results show that I am dominantly an Abstract Random Thinker. According to Dryden G. and Vos J, in their book “The learning revolution. A lifelong learning programme for the world’s finest computer: your amazing brain. ”, Abstract Random thinkers feel constricted when they're 
				subjected to a very structured environment."  This explains why I like to write my own code.
