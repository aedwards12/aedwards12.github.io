            <p>Why is pair-programming important? To me pair programming is important because I believe having a partner to work with, will help expedite the process of whatever the mission is. As partners, you can help flush out each others thoughts and ideas.  It can speed up the learning process. At times there may be concepts that I don&#39t understand that my partner can better explain it too me and vise-versa. My partner can also teach me new tricks to speed up my time efficiency. It&#39s important to my site, because the site has to be catered to a specific audience. Having a partner will help up keep me focused on gearing the website towards the viewer, whether its functionality or content.

            <p>What does driver and navigator mean?  When I think about this concept, I think of me and a friend going on a road trip. As the navigator you are in charge of guiding the driver in the correct direction. You have to look at the road map and navigate the best path to the destination. As a driver you do the steering based on what direction your navigators decides. 
            </p>
            <p>I feel my very first Group Peer Session went really well.  We were missing another cohort, so I did all the navigating, which was fine.  Lorena was an awesome driver and allowed me to dictate the roadmap for our site.  I feel we got a lot accomplish and I learned a few things along the way. I cannot wait to meet more cohorts and staff in the coming weeks. </p>
