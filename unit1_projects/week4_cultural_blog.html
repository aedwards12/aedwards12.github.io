				<h3>My Conflict 18 May 2014</h3>

				<p>In life it is only natural to have conflict with someone. It is how we handle this conflict that we can truly learn and grow from it. I have an on going conflict that doesn’t deal with a specific person but rather myself. All my life i loved to dance, but when it comes to dancing solo in front of my peers. I panic and forget the choreography.  What is starting to happen is, when the teacher starts looking at students to call out to perform the days choreography, I begin to hide in the back of the class and become withdrawn.  This is something a battle with because i really want to perform in front of the class and show my skills. When i dance with a group I perform great because i know that all eyes aren’t on me. I don’t know why i feel this way. Maybe i am afraid of being judged or maybe I’m not good enough. I think i shy away from my skills when i know there is someone better than me in the crowd. I think I need to face this conflict by starting to dance more in the front of the class. and slowly start dancing in front of my friends until i feel confident to dance in front of the class. It is nice to write this blog and official write about it.  This is something I think about all the time when I take a dance class. I really need to find a way to stop withdrawing and face the issue head on.   </p>
