				<h3>Pairing and Giving Feedback 16 June 2014</h3>

				<h4>Pairing</h4>

				<p>In college I wish that they made us learn to work with others more often in groups to work on homework, projects, and labs.  Pairing has been great to say the least. I really like to work with others and to bounce ideas off one another to accomplish the mission.  Sometimes it can get a little frustrating but that is only natural, everything cannot be easy I guess.  I love the feeling of making something work for the first time. I haven not had a pairing session that made me upset and not want to continue. I guess I have been fortunate to have such great partners. </p>

				<h4>Reading Feedback</h4>

				<p>Reading my feedback was very surprising for me.  Most of my partners said a lot of the same thing, which is good because It makes me consistent in what I am doing.  People generally like work with me. I am easy going, I make it easy to have conversation and to allow my partner freedom to express their thoughts. When needed to give help in the area where I think they need to be going in.  I seem to also be receptive of others people information given to me.  Based on the feedback I am going to continue to do what I am doing. Right now I do not see a need to change anything.  </p>

				<h4>Writing Feedback</h4>

				<p>I generally do not like writing feedback. I understand the need of it, but I just do not like to write in general. It was difficult at times to find things to say that are actionable about my partner.  There were a few instances when I thought my partner was outstanding and I did not have anything to say for constructive criticism. As we continue to write more and more I am sure I this will become second nature to me. It is already getting easier since we started writing feedback on each. </p>
