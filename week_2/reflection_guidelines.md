# Your Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

## Reviewing Others' Reflections
Email your accoutability group a link to your repo and comment on each other's reflections using the directions in [reviewing solutions](../week_3/reviewing_solutions.md). When you are commenting, try to look at and address the following:

- Did you learn something from their reflections?
- Did anything resonate with you?
- Did they run into a problem you could help with?
- Are their any concepts you are confused about as well?
- Were you able to follow their logic?
- Do you agree or disagree with their assessment? Be sure to be kind, specific, and actionable with this feedback.
